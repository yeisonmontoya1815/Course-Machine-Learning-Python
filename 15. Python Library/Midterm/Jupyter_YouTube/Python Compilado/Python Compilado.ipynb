    "# NumPy - Exercise Complete Baseball\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, our goal is to harness the capabilities of Python, specifically leveraging key libraries such as `numpy` and `pandas`, to conduct a thorough analysis of a baseball dataset. Through the use of `pandas`, we read the dataset into a DataFrame, allowing us to explore and extract pertinent information such as player weights and heights. The subsequent conversion of these data points into NumPy arrays enables us to perform essential array operations, access individual elements, and create a 2D array for more in-depth analysis. As we delve into array properties, calculate basic statistics on height, including average and median, and explore the correlation between height and weight, this Jupyter Notebook serves as an interactive guide, providing a hands-on experience in utilizing Python for data manipulation and statistical insights, all within the fascinating context of baseball analytics.\n"
